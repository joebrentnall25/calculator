# Javascript Calculator
A basic calculator made using vanilla Javascript, html and css(sass).

## Info
I started this project on the third week of my *_Nology* course. Throughtout the development process I used all of my own logic to find a solution to the project. I ended up using recursive functions to make the calculations. The final product implements Bidmas/Bodmas.

### Languages used
- HTML5
- CSS (SASS)
- JavaScript ES6

### Design
The basis of the design was made up from looking at various different calculators and their designs. The final colour scheme was found using [dribbble.com](https://www.dribbble.com "dribbble.com")

## How it works
